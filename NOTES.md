# Wall Visualizer Notes

## Why is a brick slightly more than twice as long as it is deep?
A standard brick is long enough to cover two brick depths **plus** the mortar joint between them. That extra few millimetres keeps stretcher bonds lining up neatly, so the joints stay staggered without constant cutting or fudging.

## Why this project is a good fit
- The simulator encodes real-world geometric and planning constraints, so it mirrors the kind of practical reasoning Monumental expects from field robotics engineers.
- Rendering stride envelopes and sequencing gives rapid feedback on design decisions, making it a compelling communication tool for both roboticists and masons.
- The codebase is intentionally modular, letting reviewers inspect how I balance abstraction (bonds, strategies, renderer) with hands-on problem solving.
- Extending the project—new bonds, alternative placement strategies, richer analytics—naturally showcases how I'd iterate with the team beyond the initial prototype.
